## Domain of Interest
Our domain of interest is the olympics, we are interested in this domain because all group members enjoy watching the olympics. Additionally, we choose the olympics because we felt there was a variety of information we can look into.

### What Data-Driven Questions do we hope to answer
- How has the number of metals each country has won changed over time?
  - With the overview from [The Winter Games](https://www.dremio.com/the-winter-olympics/), we can easily see the trend of metals won or lost over the years.  
- What proportion of male winners have won multiple events compares to what proportion of female winners have won multiple events?
  - []
- What proportion of gold metal winners, only have won one metal in their career?
  - From [Visualizing Olympic Medalists](http://rio2016.thegamma.net), visualizations of metal count were provided for each athelte and we can locate them with the provided filter functions.
